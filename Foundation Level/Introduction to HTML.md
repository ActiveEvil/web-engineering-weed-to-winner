# An Introduction to HTML

HTML is a *markup language* NOT a *programming language*.

So what is the difference?

A *programming language* is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules which comprises a set of instructions used to produce various kinds of output.

A *markup language*  is a system for annotating text documents into elemental structured data, allowing software to apply implicit actions and presentation.

HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, text content to make it appear or act in a certain way. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or a hyperlink to somewhere else.
